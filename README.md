Note, this is the 4th git repository to host a version of this project.
The first repo was for a class group project, for Android (and iOS and web from the others).
The second repo was when the Android and iOS versions were migrated to one Flutter implementation.
The third repo was when I began solo development on the project, focusing just on the web using Ruby on Rails.
This, the fourth repo, was after a technology stack change within Rails and swapping the cloud host.
